# SiCS - Slovenian Cave Survey

This is a repository for underwater survey projects run within Slovenia. Each folder represents a cave project run on voluntary basis by avid cave divers. Each foder contains:
-	raw survey data (.xls exports from MNemo device for UW survey and plaintext from DistoX laser measurements for dry sections.)
-	formatted survey files and project files for “Walls”, a dedicated program for cave survey data management (free: https://texasspeleologicalsurvey.org/software/walls/tsswalls.php)
-	vector graphic files and .pdf exports of finalized maps (Adobe Illustrator)

With this repository, we aim to preserve the raw data and allow for further collaboration and advancement in exploration and survey efforts. If you would like to contribute or work on the data, drops us a dm.
