### 2025 12 16 - Line repair
**Divers:**

Sebastjan Gantar, Simon Burja, Anže Abram

**Task:**

Removed the T in the first deep section and create a jump instead. Move the line in 'Polica' section to provide a more smooth dive profile. Previously, this was the place were you had to do your first deco stop after returning from the EoL.

**Comments:**

The team was diving 2x Liberty SM RBs (Sebastjan, Simon) and Anže on OC (Air, EAN50, O2). Due to the bursted HP hose, Anže had to shorten the dive. Simon and Sebastjan managed to complete the designated tasks. However, the side line that starts near 'Polica' needs to be resurveyed. The aim is to find a shallower connection to the deeper section (45 m) in order to avoid zig-zag profile. The visibility was much worse than 4 days prior without significant rainfall in-between.

### 2025 12 13 - Scout dive
**Divers:**

Sebastjan Gantar, Simon Burja, Anže Abram

**Task:**

Check the conditions inside the cave (water level, visibility, state of the line) and familiarize Anže.

**Comments:**

The team was diving 2x Liberty SM RBs (Sebastjan, Simon) and Anže on OC (Air, EAN50, O2). The plan was to get to 'Polica' section. Due to excellent visibility (5-7 m), the team completed the task successfully in approx. 90 min. The conditions dictate that a more serious push should be planner in the near future while the conditions hold.
