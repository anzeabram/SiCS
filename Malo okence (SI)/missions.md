### 2025 12 13 - Scout dive
Divers:

Sebastjan Gantar, Simon Burja, Anže Abram

Task:

Check the conditions inside the cave (water level, visibility, state of the line) and familiarize Anže.

Comments:

The team was diving 2x Liberty SM RBs (Sebastjan, Simon) and Anže on OC (Air, EAN50, O2). The plan was to get to 'Polica' section. Due to excellent visibility (5-7 m), the team completed the task in successfully in approx. 90 min. The conditions dictate that a more serious push should be planner in the near future while the conditions hold.
